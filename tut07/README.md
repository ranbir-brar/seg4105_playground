# Scrum Guide Summary

Scrum is an agile process that helps teams work together. One of its core activities is the daily scrum meeting. This is a quick, daily team meeting to plan the next 24 hours and check on everyone's progress.

Here's what happens in a daily scrum:

It happens at the same time and place every day to avoid confusion.
The team talks about how much they've done since the last meeting and what they'll do next.
They mention any problems that might slow them down.
In these meetings, team members typically answer three questions:

What did I do yesterday to help us reach our goals?
What am I doing today to help us reach our goals?
What issues are in the way of reaching our goals?
The daily scrum helps the team stay informed and quickly deal with problems, making sure they work efficiently towards their sprint goals.

# Shape up (Chapter 13)

## Managers Tracking Progress:

Managers want to see how the project is going without always asking the team.
Teams use different ways to show their progress, like hill charts.

## Documenting Work and Issues with To-Do Lists:

Using to-do lists can be tricky because new tasks can appear, like bugs found in testing.
A finished to-do list can suddenly grow, which can be misleading.

## Problems with Time Estimates:

Estimating how long tasks will take is often inaccurate.
A task that was supposed to take a few hours might take less if the team has done something similar before.

## Using Hill Charts for Clarity:

Hill charts map out the project like a hill with two main phases: figuring things out (uphill) and doing the work (downhill).
The top of the hill represents the point where the team is clear on what to do.
Hill charts help identify when team members are stuck and need help.

## Breaking Down the Work:

Itâ€™s best to divide big tasks into smaller, more manageable parts.
Start with the most crucial parts and add details later.
If progress stops ("gets stuck"), the task may need to be broken down further.

## Handling Setbacks and Risky Tasks:

Sometimes, a task that seemed finished might need more work ("backsliding").
It's wise to start with the most uncertain and risky tasks to tackle the big challenges early.
Save the less risky tasks for later in the project cycle.
In essence, hill charts and careful task management help teams stay on track and deal with uncertainties and risks effectively.
