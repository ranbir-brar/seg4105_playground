## Summary of Pitch

"Shape Up" by 37signals is like a unique recipe for making products. It all begins with something called a "pitch." Think of a pitch as a light bulb moment or a raw idea about what could be built or improved. It's like a brief, around 800 words, description or sketch born from what customers say they need or want. It doesn’t lay out the step-by-step plan but more like what we aim to achieve. This approach doesn’t get bogged down with too many details or strict plans from the start, preferring to focus on flexible budgeting to handle unexpected hiccups along the way. While anyone can come up with a pitch, the official ones related to actual projects are usually written by a specific group.

Before creating a pitch, there’s a step called "framing." It's about identifying what needs attention or fixing but without deciding exactly how. It's key to listen to the customers during this phase as they are the ones who use the product and know what's wrong, even if they don’t know how to fix it. Therefore, the pitches should mention the problems highlighted by customers and propose a clear goal. The people working on creating the solutions need to deeply understand the problem to find it interesting and create more effective solutions. This approach inspires freedom, expertise, and motivation in creating solutions, and it’s considerate of possible issues, desires, solutions, traps ("rabbit holes"), and things to avoid ("no gos").

Lastly, "Shape Up" is also about knowing what to avoid while creating products. It warns against "rabbit holes," which are tempting paths that can lead to never-ending problems, and "science projects," bigger versions of these traps. To prevent unforeseen issues, some days can be set aside, called a “spike,” to test if the planned solutions are really feasible. In summary, Shape Up is a wise and adaptable method focusing on clear and strategic goals to solve problems, allowing for imaginative solutions to surface.
