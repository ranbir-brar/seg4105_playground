### Shape Up Pitch

We are working to add a new feature to our pre-surgery app that allows users to create their own event or surgery details. Users can easily put in the basic information like the name of the event, when it’s happening, and what it’s about, and also choose if it’s a standard procedure or something more custom. Additionally, users can select and add medical terms that are related to their event, making the event information richer and more useful.
