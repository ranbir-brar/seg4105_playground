# Pitch Review October 15th @ 7:00 PM
## (Jason’s notes)

### Ranbir’s pitch
Good feature allowing users to be able to create events in the app
These events are good for patients when scheduling their surgery
However, this feature does seem to be a bit too much to implement within a 6 week timeframe
We would need to determine the glossary terminology from our stakeholders as well as adequately test the new feature
Requirements gathering and design for this feature would most likely exceed the estimated 1-2 weeks and doesn’t seem feasible to fully implement and ship within a 6 week timeframe
For example, narrowing down the glossary terminology that we will be using might take us time as we want to make sure that we don’t have too many, but have the important ones that will be used often
As this is an important feature, it is important to do alpha testing with a focus group beforehand to ensure that it fulfills the needs of the patients before their surgeries
As we will also be supporting French and none of us are fluent in it, we will need to reach out to stakeholders to get accurate translations for the English text
It would perhaps be better if we split this up into different cycles (R&D cycle and production cycle) instead
If we split it up so that we do a prototype version in the R&D cycle, then focus on a production cycle this feature could work

### Yasser’s pitch
This pitch seems a bit complex to implement in a 6 week cycle
Similar to ranbir’s pitch, we would need to do alpha testing to gather and implement feedback from the end users
Requirements gathering and design also seems to be a bit complex for us to be able to complete it within a 1-2 week span
We would also need to adequately test the feature and have a focus group for alpha testing to make sure that nothing previously developed breaks (regression testing)
Shipping this feature after 6 weeks also doesn’t seem like adequate time
Similar to ranbir’s idea this will be a more feasible idea of split into an R&D cycle and a production cycle
We will also need to reach out to stakeholders for the accurate French translations 

### Jason’s pitch
Feature is concise and is reasonable to deliver in a 6 week cycle
As there is only a map component, testing should be relatively straightforward
Requirements gathering  (such as the actual map) and design should easily be done within the first 1-2 weeks
We could look into getting two versions of the map, one in English, one in French and display an image for each language
Testing and shipping should be able to be done without splitting the cycles into an R&D cycle and Production cycle
There aren’t other dependencies such as getting the accurate terminology in both French and English for glossary terms so implementing should be relatively smooth
Our stakeholders should also be more than happy to provide us with a high resolution image of the required maps

My pitch choice: Health-checkin map (Jason’s pitch)

## (Ranbir’s notes)

### Ranbir’s pitch
Allow users to create and customize surgical details or related events.
goal is to enhance ux and inclusivity
addresses user feedback to fill a gap in the app
simple interface for date, time, event type and description
focus on event feature
maintain simplicity without adding overwhelming features
medical glossary concise and comprehensive
could take longer than 6-weeks
translations (medical terms) pose challenges
prioritize glossary narrowing and alpha testing with group

### Yasser’s pitch
introduce health checklist feature for app
no existing feature for users to maintain a health checklist
user-friendly interface accessible from main menu
tasks mark as completed
data stored on device for privacy
6-week dev cycle
no additional features unrelated to checklist
build from scratch, no 3rd party solutions
complex for 6-week cycle
requirements gathering may take longer than expected
need regression testing and user feedback incorporation

### Jason’s pitch
integrate hospital maps into app
no current provision for users to access map of hospital
zoomable, high quality map
bottom tab navigation to map
offline accessibility
6-week dev cycle
only focus on map integration
map in english and french
feasible, well tailored for 6 weeks
requirements are straight forward
single map component means simple testing

My pitch choice: Health-checkin map (Jason’s pitch)
