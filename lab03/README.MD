We are working to add a new feature to our pre-surgery app that allows users to create their own event or surgery details. Users can easily put in the basic information like the name of the event, when it’s happening, and what it’s about, and also choose if it’s a standard procedure or something more custom. Additionally, users can select and add medical terms that are related to their event, making the event information richer and more useful.

### Breadboarding Outlines:

_Places_:

1. **Custom Event Creation Screen**:

- Fields for title, date & time, description
- Dropdown for event type (procedure or custom)
- Multi-select option for adding glossary items

_Interactions_:

1. **Create Button:**

- Upon interaction, stores the entered details and added glossary items for the event.

2. **Glossary Multi-Select:**

- Users can browse and select multiple glossary items related to healthcare to add to their event.
